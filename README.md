# Stock-Margin-Call-Application

This is a Java application that keeps track of your account and all the equity it contains. 
It uses Yahoo finance API to grab real time data so that you can evaluate your portfolio. An aditional funciton that this application has is 
that it calculates the margin of each equity and gives an indication on whether your account will receive a margin call. 

Notes:

To start the applicaiton, simply clone the repository and hit run and then the load button to load your account. If you do not have 
an account, you can create one by adding 
your name to the account and a starting cash balance, then hit save so that the data is saved. 

The margin requirement and the maintenance requirement are both entered in terms of a percentage so please do not enter in decimal number.

To quit the application you can simply exit out of the by clicking the "X" button and it will stop running, just make sure to save your account before you quit!

Enjoy!
